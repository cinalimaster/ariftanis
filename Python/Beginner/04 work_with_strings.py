print(phrase.upper().isupper()) # this line first prints pharese variable into UPPERCASE then checks if its upper or lower then prints True because it converted into UPPERCASE you can use a function one after another it is usefull

print(len(phrase)) # this len() function gives the lenght of string says how many characters in strings

print(phrase[0]) #gives first character of a string index starts with 0 indexes work with 0 1 2 3 this gives G
print(phrase[2]) #this gives r

print(phrase.index("G")) # this gives a index function parameter value 0

print(phrase.index("r")) # this gives 2 first r written in text in 2 lane (0 1 2) if its not contained it gives an error you can also use words it gives index number where it starts

print(phrase.replace("Giraffe","Elephant")) # this replaces Griaffe with Elephant and writes Elephant Academy
